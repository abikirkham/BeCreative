### Testing

### Deployment

#### Github/Heroku

**Pushing Changes:**
- `git add`: This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.
- `git push`: This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on GitHub.

#### Deploying a GitHub Repository via GitHub Pages

1. In your Repository section, select the Repository you wish to deploy.
2. In the top horizontal Menu, locate and click the Settings link.
3. Inside the Setting page, around halfway down locate the GitHub Pages Section.
4. Under Source, select the None tab and change it to Main and click Save.
5. Finally, once the page resets, scroll back down to the GitHub Pages Section to see the following message: "Your site is ready to be published at (Link to the GitHub Page Web Address)". It can take time for the link to open your project initially, so please don't be worried if it does not load immediately.

#### Making a Local Clone

1. Find the GitHub Repository.
2. Click the Code button.
3. Copy the link shown.
4. In Gitpod, change the directory to the location you would like the cloned directory to be located.
5. Type `git clone`, and paste the link you copied in step 3.
6. Press Enter to have the local clone created.


## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
